- 👋 Hi, I’m @rth2 (Robert)

- 👀 I’m interested in Game Development! Coding and design are my forte! Currently I am using Unity and C#, but I have worked pretty extensively in C++/C in the past and dabbled in other languages for projects as needed.

- 🌱 I have been growing my skills (aside from full time work) by creating tools to help my son create his own game.

- 💞️ I love to collaborate and am looking for a group/company to work and grow with on a salary basis!
