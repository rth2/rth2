- 👋 Hi, I’m @rth2 (Robert)

- 👀 I’m interested in Game Development! Coding and design are my forte! Currently I am using Unity and C#, but I have worked pretty extensively in C++/C in the past and dabbled in other languages for projects(like Python, CSS, HTML5...).

- 🌱 I am expanding interests by working on my first shippable title while continueing to earn Unity certificates through GameDev TV online courses!

- 💞️ I love to collaborate and am looking for permanent or freelance (long or short term) employment!
