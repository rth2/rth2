- 👋 Hi, I’m @rth2 (Robert)

- 👀 I’m interested in Game Development! Coding and design are my forte! Currently I am using Unity and C#, but I have worked pretty extensively in C++/C in the past and dabbled in other languages for projects as needed.

- 🌱 I have been exploring my coding interests by freelancing on long and short term projects, tutoring, and working on my own projects!

- 💞️ I love to collaborate and am looking for a group/company to work and grow with!
