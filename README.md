- 👋 Hi, I’m @rth2 (Robert)

- 👀 I’m interested in Game Development! Coding and design are my forte! Currently I am using Unity and C#, but I have worked pretty extensively in C++/C in the past and dabbled in other languages for projects as needed.

- ⌨ I'm currently working as a Unity Developer on a small team (many hats!) on a live mobile game.

- 🎃 I released my first game "Critter" on Google Play and Itch.io! It isn't a particularly pretty game but it runs well and seems to be bug free. This was a project proving that I could take a project from concept to release.

  - Google Play: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.CracklingLeafGames.Critter
  - Itch.io: https://rth2.itch.io/critter

- 🌱 I am exploring my coding interests by freelancing and working on personal projects!

- 💞️ I love to collaborate and am looking for long term employment or contracts.
