- 👋 Hi, I’m @rth2 (Robert)

- 👀 I’m interested in coding and design. Game development was my initial inspiration. 

- 🌱 I’m currently learning game development using Unity. I am also working on design analysis off of github.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate in small roles for design or code. The emphasis would be something that I can use as part of a portfolio. My goal would be to take this experience and leverage it into paid work down the line, with other companies or with the other collaborators.

- 📫 How to reach me : I will fill this out with a website at some point.
